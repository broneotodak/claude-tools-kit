# CTK Constraint Fix Summary - July 22, 2025

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem
- CTK was saving memories with `source='claude_code'`
- Database constraint only allowed: `['claude_desktop', 'cursor', 'manual', 'other']`
- Memories were being rejected with constraint violation error

### Solution Applied
1. Updated `claude_desktop_memory_source_check` constraint
2. Added `'claude_code'` to allowed values
3. Tested and verified CTK can now save memories

### Test Results
```
✅ Memory saved successfully!

## What This Means
- ✅ CTK memories now save without errors
- ✅ FlowState dashboard will display CTK activities
- ✅ Proper separation between Claude Desktop and Claude Code sources
- ✅ All 372+ TODAK, 153+ FlowState memories remain intact
- ✅ Project context switching works properly

## Verification
The following memories were saved successfully after the fix:
1. CTK Database Fix (ID: 2394) - Importance 7
2. THR Currency Conversion (ID: 2395) - Importance 6

## Next Steps
- Monitor FlowState dashboard for CTK activities
- Continue using CTK normally - no changes needed
- All future memories will save with `source='claude_code'`
