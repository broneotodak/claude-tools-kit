# THR Backend Status Report

## 🔍 Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Main Employee Table (`thr_employees`)**
   - 518 employees successfully imported
   - All JSONB fields working (contact_info, personal_info, etc.)
   - Data quality fixed (42 name swaps corrected)

2. **Employee View (`thr_employees_view`)**
   - Denormalized view for easy querying
   - Used by frontend dashboard
   - Includes all employee details

3. **Reference Tables (structure exists)**
   - Organizations, Departments, Positions
   - All properly linked to employees

### ❌ What's NOT Working
1. **Related Tables Don't Exist in Database**
   - `thr_leave_types` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_leave_balances` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_claims` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_claim_types` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_assets` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_asset_categories` - NOT FOUND
   - `thr_asset_assignments` - NOT FOUND

2. **The Issue**
   - Tables were created in our local tools but never in Supabase
   - Frontend queries fail with 404 errors
   - Dashboard shows mock data instead of real data

## 🛠️ Solution Required

### Step 1: Create Tables in Supabase
Run the SQL script `thr-create-tables-simple.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the script
4. Execute it

### Step 2: Populate Reference Data
After tables are created, run:
```bash
node tools/thr-populate-all-tables.js
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Service
The `employeeService.js` is currently returning mock data. Once tables exist, we can restore the real queries.

## 📊 Table Relationships

```
thr_employees (MAIN)
    ├── thr_leave_balances (employee_id)
    ├── thr_claims (employee_id)
    ├── thr_asset_assignments (employee_id)
    └── thr_leave_requests (employee_id)

Reference Tables:
    - thr_leave_types
    - thr_claim_types  
    - thr_asset_categories
    - thr_assets
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **No Foreign Key Constraints Yet**
   - To avoid complexity, we're not using FK constraints initially
   - Will add them later once data is stable

2. **Service Role Key Issues**
   - Current service role key might have limited permissions
   - May need to check Supabase dashboard for proper API keys

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - These tables will be small (< 10k records each)
   - No immediate need for complex indexes
   - Can optimize later based on usage patterns

## 🎯 Next Steps After Tables Created

1. **Test Data Flow**
   - Verify leave balances load
   - Check claims display
   - Confirm asset assignments work

2. **Remove Mock Data**
   - Update `employeeService.js` to use real queries
   - Test performance with real data

3. **Add Business Logic**
   - Leave approval workflow
   - Claim approval process
   - Asset tracking

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All tables currently have open permissions (for MVP)
- Need to implement RLS policies before production
- Consider row-level security based on employee hierarchy
