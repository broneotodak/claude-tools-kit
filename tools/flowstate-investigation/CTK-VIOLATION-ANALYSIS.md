# CTK Violation Analysis - Wrong Directory Usage

## What Happened
Created 6+ files in `/Users/broneotodak/claude-tools/` instead of `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/claude-tools-kit/`

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Working Directory Confusion**: Started in `/Users/broneotodak/claude-tools` from previous commands
2. **Muscle Memory**: Previous patterns of creating temporary scripts in claude-tools
3. **Missing CTK Check**: Didn't verify correct project directory before creating files

## Why This Violates CTK

According to CTK hierarchy:
- **Global Rules**: `/Users/broneotodak/.claude/CLAUDE.md` 
- **Project Rules**: `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/claude-tools-kit/CLAUDE.md`
- **Tool Rules**: Should follow project structure

CTK clearly states:
- claude-tools-kit is the main CTK project
- All CTK-related files must go in the project directory
- `/claude-tools/` appears to be a legacy/temp directory

## Files Affected
1. `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V16.md` - Critical system prompt
2. `memory-system-investigation-report.md` - Investigation findings
3. `flowstate-memory-fix.md` - Fix documentation
4. `memory-tables-comprehensive-report.md` - Table analysis
5. `fix-neo-macbook-entry.js` - Fix script
6. `create-activity-log.sql` - SQL schema

## Corrective Actions Taken
1. ✅ Moved all files to `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/claude-tools-kit/tools/flowstate-investigation/`
2. ✅ Added to git for proper tracking
3. ✅ Created this analysis to prevent future violations

## Prevention Measures
1. Always check current directory before creating files
2. Use full paths when creating CTK-related files
3. Remember: claude-tools-kit is the canonical location
4. Add directory check to workflow

## Learning
Even when "following CTK", must actively verify directory context. CTK compliance requires constant vigilance, not just good intentions.
