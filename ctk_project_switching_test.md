# CTK Project Context Switching - How It Works

## 🎯 **YOUR CONCERN IS VALID - BUT CTK SOLVES IT!**

You asked: *"When we start working in different project, will claude code forgot about that ctk or memory or whatever steps we've built for it?"*

**The Answer: NO! CTK is designed specifically to maintain project-specific context across switches.**

## 📊 **PROOF: Your Memory Database by Project**

CTK has been tracking your work across multiple projects with rich context:

| Project | Memories | Latest Work | Context Type |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **TODAK** | 372 memories | July 2, 2025 | WhatsApp bot, n8n workflows, Sofia AI |
| **Firasah** | 165 memories | June 25, 2025 | AI facial analysis project |
| **FlowState** | 153 memories | July 1, 2025 | Time tracking, dashboard development |
| **ARS** | 36 memories | June 23, 2025 | AI Recruitment System |
| **THR** | 19 memories | June 9, 2025 | Employee data migration |
| **CTK** | 16 memories | July 10, 2025 | This system we just set up! |
| **ATLAS** | 1 memory | June 10, 2025 | Asset tracking system |

## 🔄 **How CTK Project Context Switching Works**

### **1. Directory-Based Detection**
```bash
# When you navigate to different projects:
cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/TODAK
claude  # ← CTK loads TODAK context (372 memories)

cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/FlowState
claude  # ← CTK loads FlowState context (153 memories)
```

### **2. Automatic Memory Loading**
CTK's `claude()` function:
1. **Detects current directory** → Identifies project
2. **Queries relevant memories** → Loads project-specific context  
3. **Shows recent work** → Displays last activities for that project
4. **Configures tools** → Sets up project-specific integrations

### **3. Example: TODAK vs FlowState Context**

**TODAK Project Context (Latest Memories):**
- Privacy policy implementation
- n8n workflow management (TODAK A.I workflow ID: gsLxdDUD6Ri9idiC)
- Sofia AI integration with THR database
- WhatsApp webhook: https://n8n.todak.io/webhook/todak-webhook

**FlowState Project Context (Latest Memories):**
- Smart activity detection system
- Time tracking implementation
- Dashboard 406 error fixes
- Real-time project monitoring

## 🧠 **CTK Memory Persistence Architecture**

```
┌─ Project Directory Detection ─┐
│   /Projects/TODAK/            │ → Loads TODAK memories
│   /Projects/FlowState/        │ → Loads FlowState memories  
│   /Projects/Firasah/          │ → Loads Firasah memories
└────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─ Memory Database Query ────────┐
│ SELECT * FROM claude_memory    │
│ WHERE category = 'PROJECT'     │ 
│ ORDER BY importance DESC       │
└────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─ Context Loading ──────────────┐
│ • Recent work                  │
│ • Key decisions                │
│ • Technical solutions          │
│ • Project status               │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ **Testing Project Context Switching**

**Test 1: TODAK Project**
```bash
cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/TODAK
claude

# Expected Output:
🚀 CTK: Loading project context...
📚 TODAK Project - 372 memories found
💭 Recent: Privacy policy, n8n workflows, Sofia AI
🔧 Tools: WhatsApp API, n8n.todak.io, THR database
⚡ Ready with TODAK context!
```

**Test 2: FlowState Project**  
```bash
cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai
claude

# Expected Output:
🚀 CTK: Loading project context...
📚 FlowState Project - 153 memories found  
💭 Recent: Time tracking, dashboard, activity detection
🔧 Tools: Supabase dashboard, activity monitoring
⚡ Ready with FlowState context!
```

## 🔧 **Why CTK Won't "Forget"**

### **1. Persistent Memory Database**
- All conversations saved to `claude_desktop_memory` table
- Project categorization maintains separation
- Context survives across sessions, reboots, even months

### **2. Automatic Context Loading**
- No manual setup required per project
- Intelligent project detection
- Relevant memory retrieval based on directory

### **3. Cross-Project Learning**
- Solutions from one project inform others
- Technical patterns recognized across projects
- But project-specific context remains isolated

## 🎯 **What This Means for You**

**✅ Switch Freely Between Projects**
- Each project maintains its own context
- No loss of progress or knowledge
- Automatic context restoration

**✅ No Manual Setup Required**
- CTK handles project detection automatically
- Memory loading happens behind the scenes
- Just `cd` and `claude` - that's it!

**✅ Cumulative Intelligence**
- Each project gets smarter over time
- Cross-project insights when relevant
- Personal knowledge base grows continuously

## 🚀 **Next Steps: Test It Yourself**

1. **Navigate to TODAK:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/TODAK
   claude
   ```

2. **Start a conversation about TODAK**
   - Ask about the WhatsApp bot
   - CTK should load 372 TODAK memories
   - Context should be specific to TODAK work

3. **Switch to FlowState:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai  
   claude
   ```

4. **Start a conversation about FlowState**
   - Ask about the dashboard
   - CTK should load 153 FlowState memories
   - Context should be specific to FlowState work

## 🎉 **The Magic: No Context Loss**

CTK transforms Claude Code from a "forgetful" tool into an **intelligent project partner** that remembers everything about each project and automatically switches context as you move between them.

**Your concern about forgetting is exactly what CTK was built to solve! 🧠✨**
